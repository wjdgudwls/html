                <p>Yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away.</p>

                <p>Now it looks as though they're here to stay. </p>

                <p>Oh, I believe in yesterday. </p>

                <p>Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be. </p>

                <p>There's a shadow hanging over me. </p>

                <p>Oh, yesterday came suddenly. </p>

                <p>Why she had to go, I don't know, she wouldn't say. </p>

                <p>I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday. </p>

                <p>Yesterday love was such an easy game to play. </p>

                <p>Now I need a place to hide away. </p>

                <p>Oh, I believe in yesterday. </p>

                <p>Why she had to go, I don't know, She wouldn't say. </p>

                <p>I said something wrong, Now I long for yesterday. </p>

                <p>Yesterday love was such an easy game to play. </p>

                <p>Now I need a place to hide away. </p>

                <p>Oh, I believe in yesterday.</p>
